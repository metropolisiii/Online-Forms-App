"Jason","Giardino","Comcast","Senior Engineer","Jason_Giardino@cable.comcast.com","I am extremely fascinated by the intersection of creativity and technical engineering. I recently had my first successful invention go through the process of being submitted to the US patent office via my company, and the process of having the first spark of an idea to fix an unusual problem, to testing the validity of the solution, to deploying the solution, and finally to working with our legal team to turn that idea into a patent application was one of the most exciting things I have ever done in my career. From top down, we receive goals of \"Innovate 10 new things this year!\" but I think the process and grit and hard work of innovation often go unexamined. This boot camp would be a fantastic opportunity to truly learn what it takes to innovate.","08/21/2014","569.70\n","IBC2014-01","","",
