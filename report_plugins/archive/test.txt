User pays via the system - Everyone gets listed as paid
New people added to the form after paid are not listed as paid
If the user pays on site, the admin clicks the pay button and 5 other people listed on the form are also checked
Admin has the ability to uncheck one and check another (basically if more than 0 are already checked)
